# Simulation

This folder contains VHDL testbenches and test code for testing the various different CPU/FPGA/MOTHERBOARD configurations

These are not intended as unit-tests but will usually be hacked around to perform a specific test. Caution should be exercised when looking at the test-code as much of it may be out of date.
